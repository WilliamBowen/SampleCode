#William Bowen's Sample Code
The purpose of this repository is to hold sample code designed to demonstrate my coding skills.  

##Sorting
MySort class includes example implementations of bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quick sort algorithms. Each method takes an array of integers and returns a sorted array in ascending order.

##Hash Tables
ChainingHashTable uses an array of single linked lists to store key-value pairs. OpenAddressHashTable uses an expanding array to store key-value pairs.
