#William Bowen's Sample Code
The purpose of this repository is to hold sample code designed to demonstrate my coding skills.  

MySort class includes example implementations of bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quick sort algorithms. Each method takes an array of integers and returns a sorted array in ascending order.

MyHashTable (work in progress).
